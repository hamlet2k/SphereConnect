Implement a Wingman-AI skill for ConnectSphere that maps voice commands (“Create objective: Collect 500 SCU Gold”, “Assign task Scout Route to Pilot X”, “Delivered 100 SCU Gold”) to a Flask API (local or AWS Lambda Free Tier). Use Wingman-AI’s STT/TTS/LLM for intent detection and metric parsing (e.g., SCU). Ensure seamless UX with defaults (e.g., ad-hoc squads) and clear fallback feedback. Test with Star Citizen community for 90%+ accuracy, <2s latency.
