/**
 * AdminDashboard Test Suite Specification
 *
 * This file outlines the test cases for the AdminDashboard component.
 * Tests cover guild management functionality including switching, invites, joining, leaving, and deletion.
 *
 * Test Categories:
 * 1. Guild Switching - PATCH /api/users/{id}/switch-guild
 * 2. Invite Creation - POST /api/invites
 * 3. Join Guild - POST /api/users/{id}/join
 * 4. Leave Guild - POST /api/users/{id}/leave
 * 5. Kick User - POST /api/admin/users/{id}/kick
 * 6. Guild Deletion - DELETE /api/admin/guilds/{id}
 * 7. Error Handling - Various HTTP error codes
 * 8. UI State Management - Loading states and updates
 *
 * Key Test Scenarios:
 * - Successful operations with valid data
 * - Error handling for invalid inputs
 * - Permission checks and RBAC enforcement
 * - UI updates after operations
 * - Loading states during API calls
 * - Protection of personal guilds (is_solo=true)
 * - Member limit enforcement (402 errors)
 * - Invite code validation and expiration
 *
 * Note: Actual test implementation requires Jest setup with proper mocking
 * of React hooks, API calls, and localStorage.
