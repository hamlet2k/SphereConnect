## Core Concepts

### Objectives
Objectives are your guild's missions or goals. They contain:
- **Brief**: High-level description
- **Tactical**: Detailed execution plan
- **Classified**: Sensitive information (rank-restricted)
- **Metrics**: Success criteria (e.g., "Deliver 500 SCU Gold")

### Tasks
Tasks are specific actions within objectives:
- **Sub-components** of larger missions
- **Assignable** to specific users or squads
- **Schedulable** with flexible timing
- **Trackable** with progress updates

### Squads
Squads are groups for coordinated operations:
- **Ad-hoc creation** via voice commands
- **Automatic assignment** based on skills
- **Filtered communications** for focused coordination

### Ranks and Permissions
- **Hierarchical access** to information
- **Role-based permissions** for actions
- **Security classification** for sensitive data

## Voice Command Examples

### Objective Management
```
"Create objective: Mine 1000 SCU Quantanium in Crusader"
"Update objective: Add tactical details for mining operation"
"Show me objectives for my rank"
```

### Task Management
```
"Assign task Scout Route to Pilot Johnson"
"Schedule task Mining Run for 30 minutes from now"
"Mark task completed: Delivered 500 SCU Gold"
```

### Status and Information
```
"What objectives are available?"
"What's my current squad assignment?"
"Show progress on Trade Route Security objective"
```

### Administrative (Officer+)
```
"Promote user Johnson to NCO rank"
"Create new squad: Mining Team Alpha"
"Set objective priority to critical"
```

## Best Practices

### For Guild Leaders
1. **Start Small**: Begin with 1-2 objectives to test workflows
2. **Define Clear Ranks**: Establish clear hierarchies early
3. **Train Members**: Provide voice command tutorials
4. **Regular Reviews**: Weekly objective progress reviews
5. **Feedback Loops**: Collect member feedback for improvements

### For Members
1. **Keep PIN Secure**: Never share your voice authentication PIN
2. **Update Availability**: Use voice commands to set your status
3. **Report Progress**: Regularly update task completion
4. **Use Voice Efficiently**: Practice common commands
5. **Check Notifications**: Stay updated on objective changes

### Voice Interaction Tips
